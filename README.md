This repository contains the code from Sissel & Sofia's Cognitive Neuroscience exam. 

**Preprocessing**
In the Preprocessing notebooks, our preliminary subject-level analysis can be found. This was used for initial ICA and channel flagging. 
However, the raw data is loaded in the analysis notebook, and the two participants' data is prepocessed in a common loop. 

**Analysis**
Analysis.ipnyb contains all the code used for our paper's analysis.
The notebook is sectioned into data retrieval; initial plots (participant-level and deviant and standrard plotted separately); peak search in time windows from literature; butterfly plots; statistical analyses; individual statistical analyses.

The collected EEG data used for analysis is not in this repository for privacy reasons.
