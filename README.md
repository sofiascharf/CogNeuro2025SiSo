This repository contains the code from Sissel & Sofia's Cognitive Neuroscience exam. 

In the 01-preprocessing and 02-epoch notebooks, our preliminary subject-level analysis can be found. This was used for initial ICA and channel inspections. 

However, the raw data is loaded in OWN_STATS, and the two participants' data is prepocessed in a common loop. OWN_STATS contains all the code used for our paper's analysis.

The notebook is sectioned into data retrieval; initial plots (participant-level and deviant and standrard plotted separately); peak search in time windows from literature; butterfly plots; statistical analyses; individual statistical analyses.

The collected EEG data used for analysis is not in this repository for privacy reasons.
